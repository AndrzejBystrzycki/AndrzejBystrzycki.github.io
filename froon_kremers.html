<p>Lisanne Froon and Kris Kremers were young Dutch women who went to Panama and they never came back from there. You can find comprehensive material about their disappearance and death on the Cold Case blog (<a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-disappearance-of-kris-kremers-and.html" target="_blank">part 1</a>, <a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-disappearance-of-kris-kremers-and_3.html" target="_blank">part 2</a>, <a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-disappearance-of-kris-kremers-and_11.html" target="_blank">part 3</a>). Here I tried to analyse some shadows in the photographs left by the girls. I tried to find what the shadows tell us about their disappearance. In every available photo I tried to find shadows that would enable me to calculate the time of taking the photo. The methods used to determine the time of taking a photo are described <a href="shadows_photos.html" target="_blank">here</a>. (You can find the descriptions in the menu on the left - point "Shadows in photos"). A summary of my results can be found <a href="photos_times.html" target="_blank">here</a> (point "1.1 Photos and times" on the left). The detailed descriptions of my calculations for every analysed photo can be found in the menu on the left.<br />
