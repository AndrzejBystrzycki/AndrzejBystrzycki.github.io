<p><span class="style4">In memory of Lisanne Froon (1991-2014) and Kris Kremers (1992-2014)</span><br />
<p>Lisanne Froon and Kris Kremers were young Dutch women who went to Panama and they never came back from there. You can find comprehensive material about their disappearance and death on the Cold Case blog (<a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">part 1</a>, <a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2021/03/part-2-with-new-leads-new-swimming.html" target="_blank">part 2</a>, <a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-disappearance-of-kris-kremers-and_11.html" target="_blank">part 3</a>, <a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2019/02/part-4-with-latest-updates-on.html
" target="_blank">part 4</a>). The collection <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOaDcK-zyudR_UXP4xNvvSpKhbEUNHFkl1cvaGaZrvkiKqkgSL0BK5mjUL2SGcDjw?key=UjkzUHpsRmtLNUc2RlphdjVTWHRZSVEySjNYS0NR" target="_blank">Juanswers for Kris Kremers & Lisanne Froon</a> contains many photos and a lot of analysis material. Here, I tried to analyse some shadows in the photographs left by the girls. I tried to find what the shadows tell us about their disappearance. In every available photo, I tried to find shadows that would enable me to calculate the time of taking the photo. The methods used to determine the time of taking a photo are described <a href="shadows_photos.html" target="_blank">here</a>. (You can find the descriptions in the menu on the left - point "Shadows in photos"). A summary of my results can be found <a href="photos_times.html" target="_blank">here</a> (point "1.1 Photos and times" on the left). The detailed descriptions of my calculations for every analysed photo can be found in the menu on the left. Analysing shadows is used to verify times of taking photos and time relationships between those times. To verify those times, I made an attempt to find the places on the El Pianista trail where the photos were taken.</p>
