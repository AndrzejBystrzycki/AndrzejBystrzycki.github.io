<p>Where are the places where the photos were taken?</p>
<p>I think I found the place where photo 494 was taken.</p>
<p><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/pianista_ravine1_494.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/pianista_ravine1_494.jpg" width="640" height="253"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 19-1</p>
<p>The left part of the above photo combination comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRg0wvE59Sc" target="_blank">this film</a> (at 13:51). The girl in the film is going down the trail at that moment. Compare the left part with the right part which is photo 494. The similarity of the views is striking - especially the rock on which the girl is standing. That would mean that photo 494 is a view down the trail which is rather surprising.</p>
<p>The photo below comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRg0wvE59Sc" target="_blank">the film</a> too (at 13:49).</p>
<p><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/pianista_ancient_ravine.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/pianista_ancient_ravine.jpg" width="640" height="359"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 19-2</p>
<p>The view in the shot of the film resembles the view in <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/panama-chiriqui-parque-internacional-la-amistad-sendero-del-pianista-de-arco-iris-a-la-linea-diviso-32516511/photo-20972737" target="_blank">this photo from the wikiloc website</a>. The shot of the film occurs before the shot in combination 19-1. Both shots were taken on the way down the trail. We know where <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/panama-chiriqui-parque-internacional-la-amistad-sendero-del-pianista-de-arco-iris-a-la-linea-diviso-32516511/photo-20972737" target="_blank">the photo from the wikiloc website</a> was taken. The author called the place "an ancient ravine". That is the place denoted "20972704 11:36:32" somewhere at the top of <a href="map_trail_wikiloc.html" target="_blank">the map</a>. It occurs 1.5 - 2 hours from the start of the trail depending on the rate of the hike (20 - 40 minutes before the Mirador).</p>
<p>I think the ravine in photos 492 and 493 resembles "the ancient ravine". The ravine in photo 494 seems to resemble the ravine too (I mean the right rock in the photo). So we have 3 photos that should be taken in the ravine.</p> 
<p>What about EXIF times? There are only two times on <a href="exif_times.html" target="_blank">the list</a> that would match the place: 12:42:25 and 12:42:32. That is about 18 minutes before the first photos at the Mirador were taken. The previous time is about 1 hour before the Mirador (12:03:16). The next time is 13:00:23 which must be assigned to a photo taken at the Mirador or close to the Mirador. There seems to be no sensible time for one photo of a ravine. That is a problem with the photos of ravines.</p>
<p><b>Update</b></p>
<p>I managed to find a very similar place to the one which we see in photo 492.</p>
<p><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/view_trail_beyond_mirador1_492.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/view_trail_beyond_mirador1_492.jpg" width="640" height="253"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 19-3</p>
<p>The right side of the above photo combination is photo 492. The left side is a shot from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pl6Q5Ogo5s" target="_blank">this video</a> (at 12:42). The video shows the return way on the trail beyond the Mirador (the last 14 minutes before the Mirador). That is not on the El Pianista trail. The author recorded the film in August 2019. </p>
<p>I made the below photo combination to indicate corresponding points in both shots:</>
<p><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/view_trail_beyond_mirador2_492.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/view_trail_beyond_mirador2_492.jpg" width="640" height="253"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 19-4</p>
<p>The size of stones on the path in both shots seems to be similar.</p>
<p>Another shot from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pl6Q5Ogo5s" target="_blank">the video</a> shows that both sides of the ravine in the film are as high as in photo 492.</p>
<p><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/ravine_beyond_mirador492.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/ravine_beyond_mirador492.jpg" width="640" height="359"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 19-5</p>
<p>Again the direction in which photo 492 was taken is opposite to the one in which Lisanne and Kris were going according to the official version of events.</p>
<p>Was photo 492 a stupid error of manipulators? It is too early to say that. It is quite possible that photo 492 has a different number (greater than 500).</p>
<p>We can be sure about the number of photo 493 (see my comment above <a href="exif_times.html" target="_blank">the list of EXIF times</a>). Photo 494 has probably a correct number because it was taken in "the ancient ravine". The difference between the EXIF times for those photos is 7 seconds. So photo 493 must have been taken in the vicinity of the place where photo 494 was taken. We know that photo 494 is a view down the trail, and photo 493 was taken earlier. Do we see a place in photo 494 where photo 493 could have been taken? I do not see such a place. I would rather expect that photo 493 was taken in the opposite direction to the one in photo 494. So we know approximately where to look for the places in photos 493 and 494, and we know what to check on the El Pianista trail. And one more remark about those photos. Try to imagine that you are going in the ravine with a friend, you are taking two photos in opposite directions within a short time, and there is no visible person in both photos. Yes, of course, it is possible, but you need to do it on purpose. What for? Another possibility is that your friend disappeared from view. As a result there is no photo of Lisanne or Kris at that place.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pl6Q5Ogo5s" target="_blank">the film</a> we know that photo 492 may have been taken on the way beyond the Mirador. The return way from that place took 2.5 minutes (from 13:10 to 15:34 minutes in the film). The way down may have taken about 2 minutes from the Mirador. The photo has a number probably greater than 500, for example 503, 504 or 506. I would rather expect that it is 503 or 504. In this case there must be another photo taken in the vicinity of the place, because photo 503 and 504 were taken within 5 seconds (see <a href="exif_times.html" target="_blank">the list of EXIF times</a>).</p>
<p>The table below contains the list of photo numbers with necessary changes to adapt my hypothesis about the real number of photo 492:</p>
