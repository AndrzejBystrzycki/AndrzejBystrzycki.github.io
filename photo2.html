<p>A photo of Kris on the bridge on the El Pianista trail.</p>

<p>A fragment of the above photo is below. You can see clearly the shadow cast by the barrier on the bridge. I will use the shadow to determine the time of taking photo 2. The method of determining the time of taking a photo is described <a href="shadows_photos.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p ><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/photo2 (2).JPG" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/photo2 (2).JPG" width="638" height="478"  /></a></p>
<p>Here are the data needed to calculate the time of taking photo 2:<br/>
L = 51.0 pixels (shadow length, look at the red letter L in the first photo above)<br/>
H = 162.0 pixels (object height, look at the red letter H in the first photo above)<br/>
date = 2014-04-01 (April 1st 2014)<br/>
latitude = 8.812407<br/>
longitude = -82.425896<br/>
time zone = -5<br/>
DST = 0 (Daylight Saving Time, there is no DST in Panama)<br/>
<br/>
Results obtained by means of method 1:<br/>
elevation = 72.53 deg (cell B55 in the spreadsheet)<br/>
local time 1 = 13:41:56<br/>
azimuth 1 = 257.51 deg.<br/>
local time 2 = 11:25:05<br/>
azimuth 2 = 102.49 deg.<br/>
<br/>
We obtained two times and two associated azimuths. Elevation is the same in both cases. The difference is in azimuths, so we must analyse the directions in photo 2. Below is a photo showing the directions determined by the resulted azimuths.</p>
<p><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/el_pianista_bridge_azimuth1.JPG" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/el_pianista_bridge_azimuth1.JPG" width="640" height="400"  /></a></p>
<p>The photo was obtained from a screen cast of the map of the El Pianista trail on this <a href="https://pl.wikiloc.com/szlaki-wycieczki-piesze/el-pianista-23576682" target="_blank">site</a>. The black line shows the direction of the bridge. This is only approximation of the direction of the bridge. The yellow lines show the directions of sunlight determined by the above azimuths. The blue rotated letter T symbolizes Kris's body on the bridge. I assumed that her back is directed to the north-west. In photo 2 we see that the sun shines from Kris's left side, so from my assumption about the direction of Kris's body appears that the direction of sunlight indicates the time 11:25:05 of taking photo 2.</p>
<p>If we want to be precise, we must take geometry of the shadow on the bridge into consideration. It was done <a href="photo2_geometry.html" target="_blank">here</a>. That is another method to determine the time of taking a photo and it can be more precise in this case. The result obtained by means of that method is 11:08:06.</p>
<p>We have two model approximations of the time of taking photo 2. The simplest way to test the approximations is to go to the bridge during sunny weather on April 1st and take a test photo.</p>
<p>Below is a photo combination showing what position of the cast shadow we should expect on the bridge.</p>

<p>The shadow of the barrier is cast on the second element  on the bridge on the right (the second row along the bridge on the right).</p>
<p>Another photo of the bridge is below. Look at the last sloping rail of the barrier on the right on the other side of the bridge. That sloping rail determines the shape of the shadow behind Kris.</p>

<p>And another photo of the bridge. It is a side view of the bridge. The sloping rail is clearly visible.</p>
