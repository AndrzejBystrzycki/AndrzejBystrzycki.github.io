<p><span class="style1">In search of the place in photo 14 (505)</span></p>
<p>Thanks to Scarlet's discovery I managed to find a place that looks like the place in photo 505. (See <a href="https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-disappearance-of-kris-kremers-and.html
" target="_blank">part 4</a> of Scarlet's blog).</p>
<p>I made a couple of shots from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfol1KfUPc" target="_blank">the film</a> which Scarlet indicated. The film shows a ravine on the way towards quebrada 1.</p>
<p>Shot 1 (3:01). Let's call it "A view of point A in the path".</p>

<p align="center">Photo 14-1</p>
<p>The path turns right. Shot 2 (3:05). Let's call it "A view of point B in the path".</p>
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photo505/photo505_pointB.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photo505/photo505_pointB.jpg" width="640" height="400"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 14-2</p>
<p>The path turns left at point B. Shot 3 (3:08). Let's call it "A view of the place in photo 505".</p>
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photo505/place_photo505.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photo505/place_photo505.jpg" width="640" height="400"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 14-3</p>
<p>The following photo is a combination of photo 505 and photo 14-3.</p>

<p>The red lines link the corresponding points in both shots. The bottom red line links the stone behind which Kris stands. The top red line links the yellow and brown rock on the right side of the ravine. These are characteristics of the place: the stone and the yellow and brown rock in the ravine.</p>
<p>The following drawing illustrates a general view of the place:</p>

<p align="center">Photo 14-5</p>
<p>From <a href="https://camilleg.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/KL-chronologie-1er-avril-2014.pdf" target="_blank">the list of EXIF times</a> which has come out recently, it appears that photo 505 and 506 were taken at places that are close to each other. The difference in time is 6 seconds. Earlier I made an attempt to find the place where photo 506 was taken. See <a href="photos_ravines.html" target="_blank">here</a> my analysis of the view in photo 506 (that is photo 492 according to the old numbering). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pl6Q5Ogo5s" target="_blank">Another film</a> was analysed there. The film shows the place on the way towards the Mirador (that is the return way in the opposite direction to the one in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfol1KfUPc" target="_blank">the film</a>). 12:16 Romain (the author of the film) reaches point C. We can see several stones. Kris stood behind one of the stones. 12:28 a view of point B. The path turns right. 12:42 Romain stands at point A, the camera shows a view that resembles the view in photo 506. </p>   
<p>The sequence of events in the ravine on April 1st 2014: Lisanne reaches point B, Kris stands at point C. Lisanne takes photo 505. Then Lisanne turns back. She walks a couple of meters to the point A (up the trail, towards the Mirador). She takes photo 506. 6 seconds passes between both shots according to EXIF times. That time (6 seconds) needs to be checked by an investigation team. The above version of events assumes that Lisanne was the photographer which does not have to be true. Notice that if my interpretation is correct, Lisanne had to return to take photo 506.</p>
