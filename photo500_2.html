<p>Photo 500 with some points illustrating the directions in the photo. Check <a href="angles_mirador.html" target="_blank">here</a> how the directions were determined.</p>

<p>Below is a map comparing the real sunlight direction and the direction of sunlight which we see in photo 500. </p>

<p align="center">Photo 11-1</p>
<p>This is the first interpretation of the directions in the photo. The rotated letter T symbolizes Lisanne. The blue line is the optical axis. That is the line that comes straight out of the camera. The azimuth of that line equals the azimuth of the center of photo 500 (81.69 degrees). The azimuth of the bottom yellow line corresponds to time 13:01:44 (corrected EXIF time of photo 500). The red line corresponds to sunset, the green line to sunrise. There is a large difference between the visible direction of sunlight and the direction of sunlight arising from calculations.</p>
<p>Below is another interpretation of directions of sunlight in photo 500. It illustrates the maximum acceptable anticlockwise rotation of the letter T. There is still a significant difference between the visible sunlight direction and the direction of sunlight predicted by the scientific model.</p>

<p align="center">Photo 11-2</p>
<p>Finally the interpretation in which the azimuth of the optical axes is directly opposite to the azimuth of sunlight predicted by the model. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/mirador_noaa_13_01_44directions2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/mirador_noaa_13_01_44directions2.jpg" width="640" height="359"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 11-3</p>
<p>The camera was rotated anticlockwise. Is this possible? Of course not. In photo 500 we see that the sunlight does not shine in the back of the photographer. In addition, according to the interpretation the summit visible in photo 500 is outside of the angle of view of the camera.</p>
<p>Photo 500 is probably a fake photo.</p>
<p>Why did someone make the fake photo? To remove a picture of a perpetrator? We see no stress on Lisanne's face in photo 500. What is difference between shadows in photo 499 and 500? The shadow on Lisanne's body is clearly weaker in photo 500. What would cause a weaker shadow? Maybe it weren't the clouds as we see in the photo. Maybe the sun was hiding behind the trees on the west side of the Mirador. The girls returned to the Mirador at the time when the sun started to hide behind the trees. That is the next thing that needs to be checked. What time does the sun start to hide behind the trees at the Mirador on April 1st?</p>
