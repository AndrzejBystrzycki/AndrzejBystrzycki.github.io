<p>Photo 500 with some points illustrating the directions in the photo. Check <a href="angles_mirador.html" target="_blank">here</a> how the directions were determined.</p>

<p>Below is a map comparing the real sunlight direction and the direction of sunlight which we see in photo 500. </p> 
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/mirador_noaa_13_01_44directions.jpg" target="_blank">

<p align="center">Photo 11-1</p>
<p>This is the first interpretation of the directions in the photo. The rotated letter T symbolizes Lisanne. The blue line is the optical axis. That is the line that comes straight out of the camera. The azimuth of that line equals the azimuth of the center of photo 500 (81.69 degrees). The azimuth of the bottom yellow line corresponds to time 13:01:44 (corrected EXIF time of photo 500). The red line corresponds to sunset, the green line to sunrise. There is a large difference between the visible direction of sunlight and the direction of sunlight arising from calculations.</p>
<p>Below is another interpretation of directions of sunlight in photo 500. It illustrates the maximum acceptable anticlockwise rotation of the letter T. There is still a significant difference between the visible sunlight direction and the direction of sunlight predicted by the scientific model.</p>

<p align="center">Photo 11-2</p>
<p>Finally the interpretation in which the azimuth of the optical axis is directly opposite to the azimuth of sunlight predicted by the model. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/mirador_noaa_13_01_44directions2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/mirador_noaa_13_01_44directions2.jpg" width="640" height="359"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 11-3</p>
<p>The camera was rotated anticlockwise. Is this possible? Of course not. In photo 500 we see that the sunlight does not shine in the back of the photographer. In addition, according to the interpretation the summit visible in photo 500 is outside of the angle of view of the camera.</p>
<p>The direction of sunlight seems to be wrong. Was the photo manipulated or did I overlook something in the analysis?</p>
<p>Let's measure the slope of Lisanne's body in the photo.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/Lisanne_slope.JPG" target="_blank">

<p align="center">Photo 11-4</p>
<p>Now we can make a 3D model of the scene in the photo using the following <a href="http://andrewmarsh.com/apps/staging/sunpath3d.html" target="_blank">on-line tool</a>. I downloaded a free 3D model of a woman from <a href="https://free3d.com/3d-models/" target="_blank">this site</a>. The following photo shows the result:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/photo500_3dmodel_woman_13_02a.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/photo500_3dmodel_woman_13_02a.jpg" width="640" height="400"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 11-5</p>
<p>Here is another view of the model:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="crime/froon_kremers/photos/photo500_3dmodel_woman_13_02b.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="crime/froon_kremers/photos/photo500_3dmodel_woman_13_02b.jpg" width="640" height="400"  /></a></p>
<p align="center">Photo 11-6</p>
<p>The model of the woman was first rotated down forward at 33 degrees (90 - 57 = 33; see the angle in photo 11-4) and then rotated just like the model in photo 11-1 above. (The initial position of the model had face directed to the south. The rotation angle was 37 degrees clockwise. 37 = 90 - 53; 53 = 45 + 8; 8.31 = 90 - 81.69; 81.69 - the azimuth of the center of photo 500. The idea of such an angle is to rotate the model 45 degrees relative to the direction determined by the optical axis of the camera.) The 3D model demonstrates that the sun was high at 13:02 on April 1st 2014 and the slope of Lisanne's body could cause that her back was highlighted by the sun. The model does not explain why Lisanne's face is highlighted (the face of the woman is shaded), but that can be caused by the fact that Lisanne's face is directed towards the photographer. In this case a more exact model of Lisanne is needed.</p>
